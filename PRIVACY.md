# Privacy Policy for Guidely

**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

Welcome to Guidely! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our mobile application ("App").

**1. Information We Collect**

*   **Information You Provide:**
    *   **Chat Messages:** The text queries you type and send to the AI assistant.
    *   **Uploaded Images:** Images you choose to upload alongside your text queries (if using the feature).
    *   **Validation Feedback:** Your responses (Yes, No, Correct, Skip) and any correction text you provide for AI responses.
*   **Information Collected Automatically:**
    *   **Session Information:** We store your chat history and a unique guest session ID locally on your device to maintain your conversations.
    *   **Usage Data:** We may collect anonymous usage data (like interactions with features, crash reports) through standard mobile platform services or third-party analytics tools to help us understand how the App is used and to improve it. This data is typically aggregated and does not personally identify you.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

*   **To Provide the Service:** We use your chat messages and uploaded images to interact with the underlying AI model (provided by a third party, see below) to generate responses for you within the App.
*   **To Maintain History:** We store your chat history locally on your device so you can access previous conversations.
*   **To Improve Our Service:** We use your validation feedback (including correction text) and anonymized usage data to improve the AI's performance, accuracy, and the overall App experience.
*   **To Maintain and Secure the App:** We use usage data and crash reports to diagnose problems, prevent fraud, and ensure the security of the App.

**3. How We Share Your Information**

We do not sell your personal information. We only share information as necessary to provide the App's functionality or as required by law:

*   **AI Service Provider (OpenAI):** To generate responses, your chat messages and any uploaded images are sent to OpenAI (the provider of the AI model used by Guidely). OpenAI processes this data according to its own policies. We do not share your specific user/session IDs with OpenAI in relation to your queries.
*   **Service Providers:** We may use third-party companies for services like hosting, analytics, or crash reporting. These providers only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions and are obligated to protect it.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Guidely, our users, or the public.

**4. Data Storage and Security**

*   Your chat history and guest session ID are stored locally on your device using standard mobile application storage mechanisms.
*   Data sent to our backend server (for interaction with the AI provider) is processed and may be temporarily logged for operational purposes.
*   We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information, but no system is 100% secure.

**5. Children's Privacy**

Guidely is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age limit in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy within the App or through other communication channels. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
